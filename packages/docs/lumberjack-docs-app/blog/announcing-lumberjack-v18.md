Ok it tooks us a couple of months but we are here. Lumberjack v18 is out and it brings compatibility with Angular 18 and the removal of NgModules.

This will be a short one, so no TLDR this time.

## Angular 18

With the new version of Angular out, we are happy to announce that Lumberjack is compatible with Angular 18.

## NgModules removal

In version 16, we deprecated our NgModule APIs and announced that they will get removed in version 18. See [here](https://ngworker.github.io/lumberjack/blog/announcing-lumberjack-v16). Well, here we are. NgModules are gone.

This change simplifies the API and reduces the library bundle size.

## Wrapping Up

Nothing else to add, just update your dependencies and enjoy the new version of Lumberjack.
